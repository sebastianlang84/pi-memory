# MEMORY

last_updated: 2026-04-16
scope: always-loaded bootstrap; keep lean

## 1) Current State
- Repo initialized for `pi-memory`, a lightweight local memory system for coding agents.
- Root living docs and `docs/` baseline were aligned to the `~/agentic-coding` governance structure.
- Product direction for V1 is documented in `docs/prd-lightweight-local-memory-system.md`.
- A working Pi integration plan now exists in `docs/plans/pi-extension-v1.md`.
- A v0.1 project-local Pi extension skeleton now exists under `.pi/extensions/pi-memory/`, backed by a thin local core under `src/core/` and Pi-facing modules under `src/pi-extension/`.
- The local core now supports SQLite store initialization, schema migrations via `PRAGMA user_version`, schema v2 FTS5 lexical indexing, and schema v3 persisted embeddings.
- v0.3 implemented validated memory creation: the core normalizes and persists memory records with immediate readback, and the Pi extension registers a `memory_save` tool.
- v0.4 is now implemented for lexical retrieval: the core supports metadata-filtered FTS5 search with compact result shaping, and the Pi extension now registers a `memory_search` tool.
- v0.5 now adds embedding generation/storage behind a narrow adapter: schema v3 persists embeddings in `memory_embeddings`, the store supports injected adapters, and the built-in deterministic profiles are `builtin-hash-384-v1` (default) and `builtin-hash-64-v1` (low-footprint fallback).
- v0.6 now implements hybrid retrieval in the local core: lexical FTS candidates and vector candidates are merged and reranked in application code using lexical/semantic match, scope/context, recency, importance, and confidence.
- v0.6 also adds basic near-duplicate suppression for search results and ranking-focused hybrid retrieval tests, including mixed German/English semantic cases via a mock embedding adapter.
- ADR 001 records the v0.5 embedding baseline decision.
- Verification paths now exist via `npm test` for fresh DB, migration, save-validation, persisted-readback, lexical retrieval, hybrid retrieval/ranking, and embedding persistence checks, plus `npm run smoke:memory-status` for the extension smoke run.
- Current V1 direction from the PRD and plan: local-first, single-user, SQLite-based, hybrid retrieval, Pi-first extension surface, thin local core boundary, no heavy server infrastructure.

## 2) Long-Term Memory
- Primary product goal: durable, local, structured memory for coding agents rather than raw chat archival.
- V1 must support German and English retrieval.
- V1 target integration is Pi first; later exposure via MCP or OpenAPI should stay possible.
- Retrieval quality matters more than aggressive auto-save volume.

## 3) Recent Tasks
- 2026-04-16 — Bootstrapped repo living-doc structure and added the initial PRD under `docs/`.
- 2026-04-16 — Added `docs/plans/pi-extension-v1.md` with the proposed V1 extension tools, commands, hooks, and write-policy shape.
- 2026-04-16 — Implemented the v0.1 Pi extension/core bootstrap skeleton with a working `/memory-status` smoke path.
- 2026-04-16 — Implemented v0.2 SQLite store initialization, schema v1 migrations, and core integration tests.
- 2026-04-16 — Implemented v0.3 validated `memory_save` persistence with normalized writes, low-information rejection, persisted readback, and Pi tool registration.
- 2026-04-16 — Implemented v0.4 lexical retrieval with schema v2 FTS5 indexing, metadata filters, compact `memory_search` results, and retrieval-focused tests.
- 2026-04-16 — Implemented v0.5 embedding generation/storage with schema v3, a narrow adapter boundary, deterministic built-in default/fallback profiles, and adapter-focused tests.
- 2026-04-16 — Implemented v0.6 hybrid retrieval with lexical/vector candidate merging, application-layer ranking inputs, basic dedupe, Pi result formatting updates, and multilingual ranking-focused tests.

## 4) Open Decisions
- Whether V1 should ship as a pure local library or as a small localhost service.
- How much memory creation should be manual vs assisted in V1.

## 5) Next Steps
1. Implement v0.7: the Pi `before_agent_start` retrieval hook with context-derived filters and compact turn injection.
2. Refine the schema details as needed while retrieval and update flows become concrete.
3. Define write policy and Pi integration boundary further as more tools land.
4. Keep the runtime-boundary decision explicit as an ADR if later evidence pushes beyond the current in-process extension plan.

## 6) Known Risks / Blockers
- `sqlite-vec` maturity risk.
- `node:sqlite` is currently experimental in this Node runtime.
- Local embedding latency on weaker machines.
- Memory quality can degrade quickly if write policy is too permissive.
